Our laboratory uses computational techniques to investigate the structure-function 
relationships of membrane-binding peptides/proteins and molecular basis of 
protein-protein recognition in apoptotic proteins. We also analyze large number 
of protein three-dimensional structures to identify and characterize some specific 
interactions. Mechanisms of alternative initiation in translation is another area 
of interest to our group.

We use sequence analysis tools, homology modeling and computer simulation techniques 
in our studies. We also develop our own bioinformatics softwares and databases.

The group was established in April 2002.
